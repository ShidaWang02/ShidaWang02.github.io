As a student who has just started engaging in research, I currently do not have any publications. However, I firmly believe that in the future, I will fill this page with my achievements.

<!-- {% if author.googlescholar %}
  You can also find my articles on <u><a href="{{author.googlescholar}}">my Google Scholar profile</a>.</u>
{% endif %}

{% include base_path %}

{% for post in site.publications reversed %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
{% endfor %} -->
